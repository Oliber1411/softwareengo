This activity requires you to think about data and information. 
You don't need to use any 'code' - just logic and reasoning.
# Analysis
Break down the problem and look carefully at the details and data.

### Scenario: Imagine your class raises money for a good cause each month. You have a list of how much money (a number) you raised in each month of the year. 

- How can you figure out which month raised the most money? 
There are 12 moonths in a year. Each month would have a value for money raised.
We'd compare each month to see which one had the largest value (money)

- What steps would you take to use and organise these numbers to find the answer?
I would arrange each months value (money) in order of the months and then check if its lower higher then the month "above" it, if its lower then keep it in its spot but if its higher swap it wit the one above until the one with the highest value is at the top. 
# Evaluation
Think about how to compare information and decide what is best or most useful.
Scenario: Your class is choosing between two field trips: a museum or a zoo. The class votes on the options (each student picks one). 

- How would you organise and use the voting results (the number of votes for each option) to decide which trip is more popular?  

Whichever option has the most votes is the winner (if its a two party system) if there are more than two however then each person should rank the candidates from the one they like most to the one they like least, if no candidates have a majority then the candidate with the lowest votes will be elminted adn the votes reambursed to the selected second most favoured cadidate, this will epeat until one candidate has a majority of the votes.

- What information would you compare to evaluate the best choice for the class?

The votes, what else?

# Application
Use what you know about data to solve a real-world problem or task.

Scenario: You are planning a class party. What data would you collect to help plan

- How would you organise this information to decide how much food and drink to get and make sure everyone has something they can enjoy?
I would get each antendee to tell me what they would like to eat and drink, I would then compare it to each other persons answers. If any two people asked for the same food and or drink then I would only get one of that food and or drink.

# Synthesis
Combine pieces of information to form a complete picture or new idea.

Scenario: Your teacher has one list of students with perfect attendance and another list of students with top grades. Both lists are names (text data). 

- How could you put these two lists together to find out which students are on both lists? 
Organise each list with each person who should be on the list in alphabetical order, then compare to the other list to see if it shares the same name.
- Why would it help to organise the names clearly (for example, alphabetically or in a table) when looking for students that appear in both sets of data?
Because if the names arent the same across lists its impossible to tell if a student is on both lists.

# Critical Thinking
Question the data and think about whether it is fair, accurate, or useful.
Scenario: Imagine a toy ad says, "90% of kids love this toy!" You find out they only asked 10 kids and 9 said they loved it (yes). 

- What might be wrong or unfair about this data? 
The sample size is too small and may not be accurate to the beleifs of the greater population.

- What questions would you ask before believing the adâ€™s claim (for example, Is 10 kids a big enough sample? Did they ask a fair mix of different kids?)? 
Explain why you would or wouldn't trust this claim based on the data. 
I dont beleive that 10 children is nearly enough to represent the beleifs of the population, perhaps its important to take into account the childrens other toys 

# Creative Thinking
Use your imagination to solve a problem or improve something using data in a new way.
Scenario: Imagine you want to get everyone to read more books by holding a fun contest at school. 
Think of a creative way to use data in this contest. For example, you could track how many pages or books each class reads (numbers) or have students vote for their favorite book (yes/no votes or a list of titles). 
- What data would you collect? I would keep track of how many complete pages each person has read by reling on them to give an honest answer on how many pages they've read.
- How would you use it to make the reading contest both fair and exciting?
I would let everyone access eachothers scores but only submit their own, this adds to the competitiveness that the reading competiont could have, the only problem is if people lie whi ch is not unlikely but what can you do? (im supposed to figure that out but im slacking off for this last question.)
